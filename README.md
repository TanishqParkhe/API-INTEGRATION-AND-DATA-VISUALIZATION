#OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

The COVID-19 Data Visualization Project is a Python-based tool designed to retrieve real-time COVID-19 case statistics from a public API and present the data using a bar chart. This project helps users understand the global impact of the virus by displaying the number of cases in the most affected countries. It combines data collection, processing, and visualization into a simple yet effective solution.

Project Workflow
Fetching Data from an API:
The project retrieves COVID-19 case data from the Disease.sh API, which provides up-to-date information on the number of cases reported in each country. The data is fetched in JSON format, making it easy to process.

Processing and Sorting the Data:
Once the data is retrieved, it is sorted to identify the top countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. The program extracts relevant details, such as country names and case counts.

Visualizing the Data:
Using the Matplotlib library, the extracted data is visualized in a bar chart. The x-axis represents the country names, while the y-axis shows the total number of cases. Customizations such as labels, colors, and rotated axis labels ensure readability.

Features:

Real-Time Data: The tool fetches the latest statistics, ensuring users get up-to-date information.
Clear Visual Representation: The bar chart makes it easy to compare case numbers across different countries.
Simple and Efficient: The script is lightweight and requires only Python and Matplotlib to run.
Customizable: Users can adjust the number of countries displayed or modify the visualization style.

Applications:

General Awareness: Helps individuals understand the spread of COVID-19 globally.
Research and Analysis: Useful for researchers studying the impact of the pandemic.
Government and Policy Making: Authorities can use the data to make informed decisions
